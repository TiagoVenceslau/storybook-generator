  prompt: "In the provided portrait, make a small, natural-looking mole visible on the subject's right side of the chin (i.e., the chin area on the subject's right, which appears on the left side of the image). Create a subtle, circular to oval shaped mole, slightly darker than surrounding skin, with soft edges and realistic texture. Place it near the jawline on the right chin area and ensure it is clearly visible while preserving all existing lighting, shadows, skin tone, makeup, freckles, skin texture, and the overall mood. Do not modify the subject's pose, expression, hairstyle, clothing, background, or any other facial features. If needed, gently adjust local shading to ensure the mole reads naturally, but keep changes confined to this feature only."
